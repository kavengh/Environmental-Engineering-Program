      The Environmental Engineering & Technology Program is a four-

year program designed to provide students entry-level skills and a foundational understanding of the 

world of Engineering and Sustainability. The program’s vision is to provide every student access to 

academic knowledge and basic technical skills required to be successful in pursuing engineering and 

STEM careers, by combining engineering, mathematics, and science courses that result in a logical 

thought process and problem-solving skills. Students will develop essential career preparation capabilities 

through technical experience, academic courses, work-based learning and internship opportunities. 

Employment of engineers and STEM related careers is expected to grow over the next decade.
